This Repo intends to, over time, create a collection of reference implementations of SpringBoot - Mongo operations.

The operations will be handled by a mix of MongoRepository and Mongo Template.

The operations are defined in UserService bean, and test cases are added in UserRepositoryTestWithTestContainers class.
